# **LoxServer**  

LoxServer is a **hobby implementation** of a **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** for the **Lox programming language**, written in **Go**. The project aims to provide LSP support for diagnostics, formatting, autocompletion, and navigation in lox.  

## **üöÄ Getting Started**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lox-server.git
cd lox-server
```

### **2. Run the LSP Server**  
```sh
go run cmd/lsp/main.go
```

## **üìå Current Features**  
‚úÖ **Basic LSP communication** (via stdin/stdout)  
‚úÖ **Handles `initialize` and `shutdown` requests**  

## **üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features (TODO)**  
- [x] **Lexical Analysis** ‚Äì Implement a scanner for Lox.  
- [x] **AST Parser** ‚Äì Build a parser to support syntax-aware features.  
    - [x] **Parsing Tokens** - Parse all the lox tokens to a valid AST
    - [x] **Resolution Analysis** - Check for scope issues and resolve variables
    - [x] **Panic - Recover** - Ignore errors caused by a preceding error to avoid unnecessary error reporting 
- [x] **Diagnostics (`textDocument/publishDiagnostics`)** ‚Äì Show syntax errors in real-time.  
- [x] **Go-to Definition (`textDocument/definition`)** ‚Äì Jump to symbol definitions.  
- [x] **References (`textDocument/references`)** ‚Äì Jump to symbol references.
- [x] **Formatting (`textDocument/formatting`)** - Auto format code
- [x] **Auto-Completion (`textDocument/completion`)** ‚Äì Suggest keywords and variables.  
- [ ] **Semantic-Highlighting (`textDocument/SemanticTokens`)** - code highlighting

### Bugs
- Multiline strings are breaking the application
- Diagnostics don't highlight the characters associated with the error

### **üí° Why This Matters?**  
It doesn't, This project is a **learning experience** in both **LSP development** and **Go programming**.
This is both my first LSP and my first project writing go.
It serves as an exploration of how to build a structured Go project from scratch.
